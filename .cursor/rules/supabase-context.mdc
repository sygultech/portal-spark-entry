### Instruction to the AI

Before processing the user request:

1. Attempt to include the files matching the globs:
   - All contents under `supabase/functions/**`
   - The file `schema.sql`

2. Notify the user of the result before replying:

- ✅ If both were included:
  - Say: `✅ Supabase functions and schema.sql loaded into context.`

- ⚠️ If only one was included:
  - Say either:
    - `⚠️ Only supabase/functions loaded; schema.sql not found.`
    - `⚠️ Only schema.sql loaded; supabase/functions not found.`

- ⚠️ If neither were found:
  - Say: `⚠️ Could not find supabase/functions or schema.sql — nothing was included.`

3. Then proceed with answering the user's original request.
