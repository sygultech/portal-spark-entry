# 🎯 Library Member Management - Implementation & Testing Summary

## 🔧 **FIXES IMPLEMENTED**

### ✅ **Fix 1: Library Settings Integration**
- **Problem**: Edit Member dialog didn't use Library Settings
- **Solution**: Added `useLibrarySettings()` hook and `getRecommendedLimit()` function
- **Impact**: Now shows "Recommended for [type]: X books" based on current settings

### ✅ **Fix 2: Validation Range Correction**
- **Problem**: Edit Member allowed minimum 0 books (invalid)
- **Solution**: Changed `min="0"` to `min="1"` and default from `|| 0` to `|| 1`
- **Impact**: Consistent validation across all member management features

### ✅ **Fix 3: Policy Compliance Warning**
- **Problem**: No warning when limits exceed school policy
- **Solution**: Added conditional Alert component with policy violation message
- **Impact**: Real-time compliance feedback for administrators
